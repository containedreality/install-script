# a script for installing arch linux
a script to install arch linux for *me* and *my* purposes

does not support nvme drives, there is a nvme patch however.

i'm not really expecting you to use it, but this goes without saying, any damages you cause to your machine is your fault and i am not responsible

this is meant to be ran from a live medium such as ParrotOS since that comes with realtek drivers preinstalled
